PureJS-HTML5Game

Project undertaken to learn HTML5-JS game

# Note:
* This game is undertaken to learn HTML5-JS game implementation without any framework.
However, the collision detection is not completed(Collision detection is done only for the ball to edges). 
But if you wish to learn then you can learn a lot from other completed parts.

# To test the game
